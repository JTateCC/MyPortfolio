            <h2>From CAD Engineer to Full Stack Developer</h2>
            <p>I'm on an exciting journey that has taken me from the world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to Full Stack Development with a focus on databases and backend development.</p>
            <p>During my work with CAD tools. I started to recognize the vital role of data management and automation in engineering and manufacturing.</p>
            <p>This ignited a new passion within me for coding, I started with python and wrote automation scripts before delving into the more complicated world of OOP, Django and Data Science</p>
            <p>I'm currently honing my skills as a full-stack developer through the School of Code Bootcamp.
            <p>This intense training focuses on becoming a full stack developer through team based projects, experiencing what an agile dev team is really like</p>
            <p>This Portfolio showcases my Projects, Applications and Development Blog</p>
